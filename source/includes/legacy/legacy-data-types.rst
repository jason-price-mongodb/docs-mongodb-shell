The MongoDB server stores data using :manual:`BSON
</reference/bson-types>`, which supports additional data types that
aren't available in :term:`JSON`. Compared to the legacy ``mongo``
shell, the updated MongoDB Shell (``mongosh``) has improved type
handling for the MongoDB :ecosystem:`drivers </drivers>`.
