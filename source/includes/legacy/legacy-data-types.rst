MongoDB Server stores data using the :manual:`BSON
</reference/bson-types>` format which supports some additional data
types that are not available using the :term:`JSON` format. Compared to
the legacy ``mongo`` shell, MongoDB Shell (``mongosh``) has type
handling which is better aligned with the default types used by the
MongoDB :ecosystem:`drivers </drivers>`.
