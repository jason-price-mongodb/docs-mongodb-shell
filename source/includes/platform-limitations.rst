- Amazon Linux 1, Debian 9, and macOS 10.14 aren't supported.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7, Amazon Linux 2, SUSE Linux
  Enterprise Server (SLES) 12, and Ubuntu 18.04 support is deprecated
  and might be removed in an upcoming ``mongosh`` release.
- If you must use ``Node.js`` 16 with ``mongosh``, install ``Node.js``
